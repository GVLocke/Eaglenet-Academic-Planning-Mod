# Eaglenet Academic Planning Mod

Project for my CS-3423 Web Applications class at JBU. The idea is to create a modification to the existing platform that students use to plan their four-year degree. I want to make an algorithm that generates a four-year plan based on what (if any) classes you've completed, what major(s)/minor(s) you're pursuing, whether you're in honors, etc.

Might be a bit ambitious, ngl.

## Building
Run the docker-compose file to generate the container stack.
```
docker compose up -d
```

Import the data from the .csv files in the db_bups directory.
